An implementation of statistical learning classifiers, using MatLab. The aim is get the model that can get the better accuracy in a classification problem.

Models: Classifiers {
	Tree Decision,
	Nayve-Bayes,
	Discriminant Analysis,
	Support Vector Machines,
	K-Nearest Neighbors,
	Ensembles: Tree, Subspace.
}
