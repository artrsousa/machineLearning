An implementation of statistical learning classifiers, using matlab.
The aim is get the model that can get the better accuracy in a classification problem.

Models: 
  Classifiers {
    Tree Decision, 
    Naive-Bayes, 
    Discriminant Analysis, 
    Support Vector Machines,
    K-NearestNeighbors,
    Ensembles: Tree, Subspace. 
  }
