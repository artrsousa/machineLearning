An implementation of several statistical learning classifiers, using matlab.

The aim is get the model that can get the better accuracy in a classification problem.
After the model has been selected, change in code parameters to improve even more the accuracy.

Models that may have an implementation here are : 
  4Classification {
    Tree Decision, 
    Naive-Bayes, 
    Discriminant Analysis, 
    Partial Least Square - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA),
    Support Vector Machines,
    K-NearestNeighbors,
  }
  4Regression {
  }
  
Using cross-validation with 5 fold as default.

The database used is simple and isn't complete.
